## ADR-001: Use JSON-LD Deterministic Service Template

**Date:** 2026-04-15 (template adoption — backfilled from repo creation; predates OFBT spec freeze v0.1.7 on 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Adopt the JSON-LD Deterministic Service Template as the base architecture.

**Context:** We need a service that produces deterministic, reproducible transformations on structured data. The template provides a pure kernel with spec tests, layered boundaries (kernel/composition/adapters), and zero runtime dependencies.

**Consequences:**
- All transformation logic lives in `src/kernel/transform.ts` as pure functions
- Kernel MUST NOT perform I/O, reference time, randomness, or environment state
- Infrastructure (HTTP, persistence, scheduling) lives in `src/adapters/`
- Spec tests (determinism, no-network, snapshot, purity) MUST pass before any merge

## ADR-002: OFBT-specific kernel purity allowlist

**Date:** 2026-05-02

**Decision:** Rewrite `scripts/ensure-kernel-purity.ts` with an OFBT-specific allowlist: forbid Date/RNG/env/I-O/sort-without-comparator non-determinism patterns; allowlist `tau-prolog`, `rdf-canonize`, and `crypto.subtle.digest` (SHA-256 only) as legitimate kernel imports. Tau Prolog is treated as a kernel dependency, not an adapter.

**Context:** The template's default purity check only enforced layer boundaries (no imports leaving `src/kernel/`). The architect's ruling (recorded in conversation 2026-05-02) requires the checker to also enforce the determinism prohibitions in spec §0.1, §12.9, and Fandaws Consumer Requirement §1.3 — and ruled that Tau Prolog goes in the kernel, not an adapter, because routing it through `src/adapters/` would let kernel code escape the purity gate.

**Consequences:**
- The kernel may import `tau-prolog` and `rdf-canonize` directly; no other external imports are permitted.
- `crypto.subtle.digest` is permitted for deterministic SHA-256 content addressing; `crypto.getRandomValues` and `crypto.randomUUID` remain forbidden.
- `setTimeout(0)` cooperative scheduling (used by Tau Prolog's async chain) does not violate purity — determinism is about the content of an answer, not the timing of its return.
- Adding new external dependencies to the kernel requires an ADR.

## ADR-003: ARC TSV Module column as SME deliverable

**Date:** 2026-05-02

**Decision:** The `Module` column in `project/relations_catalogue_v3.tsv` (assigning each row to one of the five v0.1 ARC modules per spec §3.6.1) is an SME deliverable, not an engineering deliverable. Phase 0 ships the compiler scaffolding (`scripts/build-arc.js`, `regenerate-arc-tsv.js`, `round-trip-arc.js`) plus a transition affordance (`arc/module-assignments.json`) that lets engineering tooling run end-to-end before the SME folds the column in. The column itself blocks Phase 4 entry.

**Context:** ROADMAP §0.6 lists "TSV gains a Module column" as a Phase 0 acceptance criterion, but unilaterally assigning rows to modules is an SME judgment that engineering shouldn't make. The compiler needs to handle two states: TSV with column (canonical) and TSV without column (transition).

**Consequences:**
- `scripts/build-arc.js` reads from the TSV `Module` column when present, else falls back to `arc/module-assignments.json`. Rows with no assignment under either mechanism are skipped with a warning.
- `scripts/round-trip-arc.js` runs in non-strict mode by default; flips to strict at Phase 4 entry once the SME has folded the Module column into the canonical TSV.
- The Phase 4 entry checklist already requires `[VERIFY]` resolution on rows 49-50; adding the Module column for those rows is part of that pre-Phase-4 deliverable.

---

## ADR-004: Tau Prolog probe seam for testability without installed peer dep

**Date:** 2026-05-02

**Decision:** Tau Prolog version detection routes through an internal probe seam (`registerTauPrologProbe`) defaulting to `globalThis.pl?.version`. Tests inject a mock probe to simulate version-match / mismatch / absent scenarios without requiring the actual `tau-prolog` package to be present in this repo's `node_modules/`.

**Context:** API spec §9.2 requires `verifyTauPrologVersion()` to be sync. The spec assumes Tau Prolog has already been loaded by the consumer. In this repo's own test environment, the peer dep may not be installed; tests must still exercise both match and mismatch paths.

**Consequences:**
- `registerTauPrologProbe(probe)` lets Node ESM consumers explicitly bind their loaded Tau Prolog to OFBT instead of relying on the browser-style `globalThis.pl` registration.
- Tests have a clean injection seam (`registerTauPrologProbe(() => "0.3.4")` for match path, etc.).
- The probe is mutable module state — the only such state in OFBT — but it is intentional: it's a registry for the consumer-controlled peer dep, not OFBT-internal state.

---

## ADR-005: CLI restructure — kernel/index.ts split into kernel barrel + top-level package barrel + adapter CLI

**Date:** 2026-05-02

**Decision:** The template-inherited CLI at `src/kernel/index.ts` is split into three files matching the OFBT layer ruling:
- `src/adapters/cli.ts` — the CLI itself (file I/O, process.argv, stdout/stderr)
- `src/kernel/index.ts` — kernel-only public barrel (errors, reason codes, version, transform/canonicalize)
- `src/index.ts` — top-level package barrel re-exporting kernel + composition

`package.json` `main`, `types`, and `exports["."]` repoint at `dist/index.js`. The `start` and new `cli` scripts invoke `dist/adapters/cli.js`. The CI `Verify CLI` step likewise updates.

**Context:** Phase 0 exit retrospective flagged this as risk (2): the existing CLI lived in `src/kernel/` but performed I/O, violating the architect's adapter-vs-kernel ruling (ADR-002). The OFBT purity checker only catches specific forbidden APIs (Date.now, Math.random, fetch, etc.), not the broader "kernel performs no I/O" principle in spec §0.2 — so a regex check wouldn't have flagged it, but the layering principle still applied.

Phase 1 will replace the underlying call (currently the template `transform` identity function) with `owlToFol`. Doing the restructure in a Phase 0 cleanup PR keeps Phase 1 focused on lifter implementation rather than scaffolding.

**Consequences:**
- Consumers `import { ... } from "@ontology-of-freedom/ofbt"` reach the top-level barrel which re-exports across kernel + composition.
- Submodule paths (`/errors`, `/reason-codes`, `/version`, `/session`, `/kernel`) remain available for tree-shaking via the package.json `exports` map.
- Kernel barrel does NOT re-export from composition (would violate purity check). The composition surface is reachable via `/session` submodule path or via the top-level barrel.
- CI `Verify CLI` step now invokes `dist/adapters/cli.js`.
- esbuild bundles target `src/index.ts` (the full public API), not the kernel-only barrel.
- 47/47 tests + purity check + corpus manifest all green after restructure.

## ADR-006: Tighten purity checker — close node:* hole, add process.* / console.* rules, enforce expected_v0.2_elk_verdict and worked-example coverage

**Date:** 2026-05-02

**Decision:** Tighten `scripts/ensure-kernel-purity.ts` and the corpus manifest gate in response to SME Phase 0 review:

- (B1) Forbid all `node:*` builtins in the kernel except `node:crypto` (and only for `subtle.digest`). Previously the rule allowed any `node:` import.
- (B2-companion) Add explicit kernel rules forbidding `process.argv`, `process.stdout`, `process.stderr`, `process.exit`, `process.cwd`, `process.pid`, and `console.*`. Catches the CLI-pattern class of violation that risk (2) flagged.
- (B1-companion) Add `no-crypto-without-subtle-digest` rule: any `crypto.X` access where `X` is not on the `subtle` chain is forbidden in kernel.
- (S1) Make `expected_v0.2_elk_verdict` REQUIRED in `tests/corpus/manifest.schema.json` and `scripts/check-corpus-manifest.ts`. `null` permitted; absent forbidden — collapsing the ELK regression-suite signal is a load-bearing failure.
- (S2) Promote `lint-arc.js` worked-example coverage check from informational to enforced under `--require-fixtures-for-verified` (folded into `--strict`). Phase 4-7 ARC Authoring Exit Criteria now invoke `--strict`.
- (S3) Add `scripts/build-arc.js --strict` "0 skipped rows" gate to Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 ARC Authoring Exit Criteria — prevents silent row-drop when a TSV row has no Module assignment.
- (S4) Reconcile Node-version claim: ROADMAP now says Node v22+ to match `package.json` `engines.node`.

**Context:** SME Phase 0 review (2026-05-02) caught three blockers and four structural items not in the exit summary. The B1 hole specifically would have allowed a future contributor to import `node:fs` directly into kernel code with no warning — exactly the failure mode the architect's ADR-002 ruling was designed to prevent.

**Consequences:**
- The kernel can no longer import `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:http`, `node:child_process`, etc. Only `node:crypto` (and only for `subtle.digest`) and the two allowlisted external packages (`tau-prolog`, `rdf-canonize`) are permitted.
- CLI pattern (`process.argv` / `process.stdout` / `process.exit` / `readFile`) cannot regress into the kernel without failing CI.
- Corpus manifest entries MUST explicitly set `expected_v0.2_elk_verdict` to either an outcome or `null` — silent omission is no longer accepted.
- Phase 4-7 ARC content authoring is on a stricter gate: every Verified entry needs a fixture; every TSV row needs a Module assignment.
- 47/47 tests + tightened purity check + tightened corpus manifest gate all green after the rule-tightening — confirming the prior CLI restructure (ADR-005) cleaned the kernel sufficiently for the new rules.

## ADR-007: Phase 1 lifter determinism conventions + cycle-guard layer translation

**Date:** 2026-05-02 (drafted at Step 5 implementation; ratified Accepted at Step 5 close cycle per architect Ruling 1 of the same cycle)

**Status:** Accepted (architectural commitment per spec §0.1; routes future lifter/evaluator boundary questions). Section 1 (cycle-guard layer translation) is the architectural commitment; sections 2-9 are implementation-choice-tier conventions per spec §0.1 and are approved as authored within the developer's domain.

**Decision:** Pin the eight determinism conventions the Phase 1 lifter has settled on, and document the cycle-guard layer translation that resolves the tension between spec §5.4 ("the lifter rewrites these axioms to thread visited-ancestor lists") and API §4 (which has no list / visited-ancestor primitive in FOLAxiom).

### 1. Cycle-guard layer translation [ARCHITECTURAL COMMITMENT per spec §0.1]

**This section is the load-bearing architectural commitment of ADR-007. It routes future lifter/evaluator boundary questions.** Architect Ruling 1 of the Step 5 close cycle: "Lifter outputs classical FOL form per spec §5; evaluator implementation details (cycle guards, tabling, step caps) are evaluator-side concerns and do not appear in lifted FOL."

The lifter emits CLASSICAL FOL semantic axioms (e.g., `∀x,y,z. P(x,y) ∧ P(y,z) → P(x,z)` for Transitive). Cycle-guarded SLD ingestion (visited-ancestor list per ADR-011) is the **Phase 3 evaluator's** concern, not the lifter's. The FOL term tree carries the equivalent encoding per spec §6.2 ("An OWL TransitiveObjectProperty declaration is logically equivalent to its Prolog rule form `p(X,Z) :- p(X,Y), p(Y,Z)`"); the Phase 3 evaluator (when it lands) translates the FOL state into cycle-guarded Prolog rules at ingestion time per ADR-011's visited-ancestor pattern.

This is the only resolution consistent with API §4 (no list primitive in FOLAxiom). Spec §5.4's "lifter rewrites" language refers to the conceptual lifter→evaluator pipeline; the rewrite to visited-list Prolog form happens at evaluator-ingestion time, not in the FOL term tree.

Architect-banked architectural consequences (from Ruling 1):
- Honors spec §0.1's three-tier framing — keeps the §0.1 implementation-choice tier (cycle guard) out of the §0.1 architectural-commitment tier (lifter output semantics). v0.2's planned SLG tabling requires only evaluator rework, not lifter rework.
- Honors API §6.1.1's determinism contract cleanly — the contract bounds to the classical-FOL form, not to a visited-ancestor encoding scheme.
- Honors round-trip parity per spec §8.1 — `lift(G₂) ≡ F₂ modulo Loss Signatures` is a property of the classical FOL state. v0.2 SLG migration will not break parity for stored audit artifacts.

### 2. Variable-allocator letter sequence

`makeVarAllocator()` yields fresh `FOLVariable` records with names from the sequence `["x", "y", "z", "w", "v", "u", "t", "s", "r", "q", "v10", "v11", ...]`. Index 0 = "x", index 1 = "y", and so on; from index 10, names switch to `v<index>` to avoid collisions with the alphabetic tail.

A fresh allocator is created at every top-level lift call (each TBox / RBox axiom; each ABox axiom). Inner calls (e.g., `liftClassExpression` recursing into restrictions) share the allocator with their enclosing top-level call — so nested restrictions allocate from index 2 onward (z, w, v, ...) without colliding with the outer `x` and `y`.

### 3. Pairwise i<j emission for set-based axioms

For axioms whose input is a set of N classes / individuals (`SameIndividual`, `DifferentIndividuals`, `EquivalentClasses`, `DisjointWith`), the lifter emits one or two FOL axioms per pair `(i, j)` with `i < j`. Within a single set, the iteration order is the source-array order. For `EquivalentClasses` the per-pair emission is BOTH directions (forward then reverse, each with a fresh allocator per direction so both bind `x`); for `SameIndividual` / `DifferentIndividuals` it is the bare pairwise atom; for `DisjointWith` it is the conjunction-implies-False shape.

### 4. Fresh-allocator-per-direction in `liftBidirectionalSubsumption`

When emitting `EquivalentClasses` mutual implications or `ClassDefinition` biconditionals, each direction allocates a fresh `makeVarAllocator()` so both emitted universals bind `x` rather than `x` and `y`. This is a determinism contract; the architect-banked convention from corpus sign-off.

### 5. Top-level pipeline order

`owlToFol` processes the input ontology in this order:
1. `rejectPuntedConstructs` (pre-scan; throws on §13.1 punted patterns)
2. TBox lifting (`SubClassOf`, `EquivalentClasses`, `DisjointWith`, `ClassDefinition`)
3. RBox lifting (`ObjectPropertyDomain`, `ObjectPropertyRange`, `ObjectPropertyCharacteristic`, `InverseObjectProperties`, …)
4. ABox lifting (`ClassAssertion`, `ObjectPropertyAssertion`, `DataPropertyAssertion`, `SameIndividual`, `DifferentIndividuals`)
5. Identity machinery emission (`emitIdentityMachinery`) — equivalence axioms + per-predicate identity-rewrite rules

Within each stage, source-array order is preserved.

### 6. Lexicographic sort for predicate sets

Where the lifter iterates over a *set* of predicate IRIs (e.g., `emitIdentityMachinery`'s per-predicate identity-rewrite rule emission), the iteration is a lexicographic sort of the canonical (expanded full-URI) form. Same input set in different traversal order produces the same axiom sequence.

### 7. Cardinality witness convention [RESOLVED in Step 7 close commit]

When ADR-007 was first drafted at Step 5, this section was framed as a "Skolem-witness prefix" placeholder, on the assumption that `minCardinality` / `exactCardinality` would Skolemize witnesses to fresh constants under a documented prefix. **Step 7 implementation revealed the framing was wrong:** classical-FOL cardinality lifting uses **existential bindings**, not Skolem constants, so no prefix is needed.

**Decision:** cardinality lifting uses ∃-bindings allocated from the standard variable allocator per ADR-007 §2 (the same `x, y, z, w, v, u, t, s, r, q, v_n` letter sequence used by `someValuesFrom` and `allValuesFrom`). No new prefix declared; no Skolem constants minted.

**Concrete shapes:**
- `minCardinality(P, n)[onClass C]` → `∃ y₁..yₙ. (⋀ᵢ<ⱼ ¬(yᵢ=yⱼ)) ∧ (⋀ᵢ P(x, yᵢ) [∧ C(yᵢ)])`
- `maxCardinality(P, n)[onClass C]` → `∀ y₁..y_{n+1}. (⋀ᵢ P(x, yᵢ) [∧ C(yᵢ)]) → (⋁ᵢ<ⱼ yᵢ=yⱼ)`
- `exactCardinality(P, n)[onClass C]` → `min(P, n)[C] ∧ max(P, n)[C]` (conjunction at the consequent level of the wrapping `SubClassOf` universal)

**QCR (qualified cardinality restriction)** with `onClass` recursively lifts the class expression against each witness via `liftClassExpression(onClass, witness, prefixes, alloc)` — supports complex `onClass` shapes structurally even though the Phase 1 corpus exercises only `NamedClass`.

**Edge cases:**
- `n = 0` for `minCardinality`: emits empty `fol:Conjunction` (logically ⊤). API §4 has no `fol:True` primitive; the empty conjunction is the canonical encoding.
- `n = 0` for `maxCardinality`: emits `fol:False` consequent ("a single witness already contradicts at-most-zero"). Uses the same `fol:False` primitive Step 2's `DisjointWith` handler introduced.

**Variable-allocation under exactCardinality:** since `exactCardinality` decomposes to `min ∧ max` sharing the outer `SubClassOf` allocator (per ADR-007 §2's "inner calls share the allocator"), the min part allocates `y, z, …` and the max part continues with `w, v, u, …` from the same sequence. Witnesses do not collide because the allocator is monotonic.

**B2 protection graduation:** the SME B2 inline regression test ("cardinality throws `UnsupportedConstructError`") is removed at Step 7 close — cardinality no longer throws. The protection graduates to fixture-level `deepStrictEqual` against `p1_restrictions_cardinality.expectedFOL`: any wrong-arity emission (e.g., a unary atom of an object-property predicate, the failure mode B2 was authored to catch) now breaks the fixture's byte-exact match. This is the architect-banked "tests must catch the wrong shape's absence, not pass coincidentally" discipline applied at the natural graduation point.

### 8. RDFC-1.0 b-node Skolem prefix [RESOLVED in Step 6 close commit]

When the input carries a Turtle / RDF 1.1 blank-node identifier (`_:label`), `canonicalizeIRI` mints a deterministic Skolem constant by concatenating the OFBT-minted vocabulary prefix with the b-node label:

- **Prefix:** `https://ofbt.ontology-of-freedom.org/ns/0.1/bnode/` (per spec §17.2 Q2 — the permanent OFBT-minted vocabulary base; the `bnode/` segment isolates Skolemized b-nodes from other minted IRIs).
- **Transformation:** `_:label` → `https://ofbt.ontology-of-freedom.org/ns/0.1/bnode/label`.
- **RDFC-1.0 canonicalization responsibility:** the caller (typically the `parseOWL` adapter when it materializes RDF input into structured-JS form) is responsible for canonicalizing the b-node labels via `rdf-canonize` BEFORE passing them to the lifter. Phase 1 corpus exercises only structured-JS inputs without b-node references; the b-node IRI form is structurally supported by the lifter (verified by the inline regression test in `tests/lifter-phase1.test.ts`), but full Phase 4+ corpus exercise (real BFO/CCO releases use b-nodes for class expressions) waits on the `parseOWL` adapter wiring.
- **Recognized form:** `BNODE_RE = /^_:([A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.\-]*)$/` per the Turtle PN_LOCAL grammar. Strict subset of the W3C Turtle b-node label grammar, sufficient for RDFC-1.0 canonical labels (which use `c14nN` form).

`p1_blank_node_anonymous_restriction` does NOT exercise the b-node IRI path because its input uses inline-restriction syntax (anonymous nested ClassExpression objects in the structured-JS form) rather than RDF b-node references. The fixture's determinism is provided by ADR-007 §2 (variable-allocator letter sequence) at the existential-witness level; the b-node Skolem prefix is exercised by an inline regression test at Step 6 and will be exercised by Phase 4+ corpus when `parseOWL` materializes b-node-bearing RDF.

### 9. Reserved-predicate canonical form [RESOLVED in Step 5 close commit per architect Ruling 3]

Reserved OWL predicates (`owl:sameAs`, `owl:differentFrom`) previously minted in CURIE-form when emitted from `SameIndividual` / `DifferentIndividuals` axioms and from the identity-machinery emission (Step 4); user-supplied predicate IRIs went through `canonicalizeIRI` and landed in expanded full-URI form. **Consequence (now closed):** a user-supplied `ObjectPropertyAssertion(property: "owl:sameAs", ...)` with `prefixes.owl` declared produced a fact with the expanded URI form, which would have been treated as a different predicate from the lifter-minted `owl:sameAs` CURIE form. SME O1 from the Step 4 review surfaced this; SME's Step 5 review re-escalated for resolution in the Step 5 cycle.

**Decision (architect Ruling 3 of the Step 5 close cycle, 2026-05-02):** **Resolution A** — internal canonical form is full URI per API §3.10.3 ("FOLAtom.predicate and FOLConstant.iri strings in OFBT's FOL output use expanded full URI form by default"). Reserved OWL predicates are no exception. The lifter canonicalizes reserved predicates the same as user-supplied ones — minted constants land as `http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs` (and `http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#differentFrom`), not as `owl:sameAs` (and `owl:differentFrom`).

Resolution B (distinct OFBT-internal namespace for reserved predicates) was rejected because (i) it would require a spec carve-out from API §3.10.3, (ii) post-freeze spec changes per §0.2 require implementation evidence not present here, and (iii) the visual minted-vs-user distinction concern (the only argument for Resolution B) lives in the rendering layer (CURIE form for human-facing diagnostics per API §3.10.4), not in the canonical FOL state.

**Implementation status:** Implemented in the Step 5 close commit. Two constants `OWL_SAME_AS_IRI` and `OWL_DIFFERENT_FROM_IRI` declared in `src/kernel/lifter.ts` carrying the expanded full-URI form; four mint sites updated (SameIndividual ABox, DifferentIndividuals ABox, identity-machinery equivalence-axiom emissions, identity-machinery per-predicate identity-rewrite-rule inner sameAs atoms); reserved-predicate exclusion check in per-predicate identity-rewrite emission switched to the expanded-form match. Coordinated re-amendment of `tests/corpus/p1_owl_same_and_different.fixture.js` updates expectedFOL from CURIE to expanded form (six atom-predicate strings) with audit-trail addendum.

**Banked principle:** "When the spec already pins a canonical form, 'we'll figure it out later' is not a deferral, it's a contradiction with the spec that compounds with each step. Resolve at the moment the contradiction surfaces." (Architect Ruling 3 of Step 5 close cycle, 2026-05-02.)

### 10. OFBT meta-vocabulary encoding choice — implicit-typing of class / object-property IRIs [RESOLVED at Phase 1 exit Step 9.4 doc pass]

Architect-ratified at the BFO/CLIF parity routing cycle 2026-05-03 ("yes the elision is sound") and formalized here at Phase 1 exit Step 9.4 doc pass.

**Decision:** OFBT's lifter elides meta-typing predicates (`(Class X)`, `(OWLObjectProperty R)`) that appear in the canonical OWL CLIF axiomatization. The lifted FOL is the canonical form's BODY universal-implication; meta-typing antecedents are omitted per OFBT's encoding choice — **every IRI used in a class position is implicitly a Class; every IRI used in an object-property position is implicitly an OWLObjectProperty.** No separate Class reification or OWLObjectProperty reification is performed.

**Concrete examples** (canonical CLIF vs. OFBT lifted form):

| Construct | Canonical CLIF (`owl-axiomatization.clif`) | OFBT lifted FOL |
|---|---|---|
| `SubClassOf(C, D)` | `(forall (X Y) (iff (SubClassOf X Y) (and (Class X) (Class Y) (forall (z) (if (X z) (Y z))))))` | `∀x. C(x) → D(x)` (the canonical form's body universal-implication; `(Class X)` and `(Class Y)` antecedents elided) |
| `Transitive(P)` | `(forall (R) (iff (TransitiveObjectProperty R) (and (OWLObjectProperty R) (forall (x y z) (if (and (R x y) (R y z)) (R x z))))))` | `∀x,y,z. P(x,y) ∧ P(y,z) → P(x,z)` (`(OWLObjectProperty R)` antecedent elided) |
| `InverseObjectProperties(P, Q)` | `(forall (R1 R2) (iff (InverseObjectProperties R1 R2) (and (OWLObjectProperty R1) (OWLObjectProperty R2) (forall (x y) (iff (R1 x y) (R2 y x))))))` | Bidirectional implication pair per ADR-007 §4: `∀x,y. P(x,y) → Q(y,x)` AND `∀x,y. Q(x,y) → P(y,x)` (both `(OWLObjectProperty)` antecedents elided) |

**Rationale.** Three points support the elision:

1. **Soundness w.r.t. OWL semantics.** Per OWL 2 Direct Semantics (§5.3), an IRI's role in an axiom (class position vs object-property position) is determined syntactically by where it appears. OFBT's encoding makes this implicit rather than explicit: the IRI's role is recoverable from its position in the lifted FOL. A consumer reasoning about the lifted FOL state can re-derive the typing from the term shape; no information is lost.

2. **Encoding cost vs. benefit.** Carrying meta-typing antecedents through every lifted axiom would roughly double the size of the FOL state for v0.1 corpus content and add a redundant universal-implication antecedent to every TBox axiom. The size cost is real (bundle budget per API §13.4); the benefit (explicit meta-typing) is recoverable from the term shape on demand.

3. **Layer separation per ADR-007 §1.** The lifter emits classical FOL semantics. Meta-vocabulary reification (if needed) is a Phase 4+ ARC-content concern, not a lifter concern. If a Phase 4+ consumer needs to query "is X a Class?", the consumer-side machinery walks the FOL state's term-shape, not a meta-typing axiom.

**Edge cases and forward-compat:**

- **Phase 4+ cross-ontology integrity checks.** If a consumer needs to verify "this IRI is used as a class in ontology A and as an object property in ontology B" (punning detection at consumer-side), the punning detector walks the FOL state's atom-shape. OFBT's lifter already rejects punning at lift time via `rejectPuntedConstructs` per spec §13.1; the §10 elision doesn't introduce a new punning vulnerability. Phase 1 punning detection is verified by `canary_punned_construct_rejection.fixture.js`.

- **v0.2 evolution.** If a future spec revision (post-v0.1) introduces a meta-vocabulary reification requirement (e.g., for a Phase 5+ ontology that relies on `(Class X)` as a load-bearing predicate), this ADR is revisited. v0.1 commits to the elision; v0.2 may add an opt-in reification mode via a new `LifterConfig.reifyMetaVocabulary?: boolean` field.

**Banked principle:** "Soundness w.r.t. OWL semantics is preserved as long as the syntactic role of an IRI is recoverable from its position in the lifted FOL. Explicit meta-typing antecedents are an encoding choice, not a soundness requirement — choose the encoding that minimizes state size." (Architect ruling at the BFO/CLIF parity routing cycle 2026-05-03.)

**Implementation status:** Implemented since Step 1 (the lifter has emitted classical-form bodies without meta-typing antecedents from the start). The §10 formalization documents the discipline rather than introducing new behavior. The `mappingNote` field on every `clifGroundTruth` entry that carries Layer A citations (`p1_bfo_clif_classical.fixture.js`'s 8 entries) explicitly documents the elision per-entry.

**Related discipline:** Section "Defense-in-Depth at Multiple Boundary Points" in `arc/AUTHORING_DISCIPLINE.md` covers the related pattern for ensuring the elision doesn't introduce silent corruption — `rejectPuntedConstructs` enforces at lift entry; downstream emit sites defensively guard.

---

**Context for ADR-007 as a whole:** Step 5 implementation surfaced three concrete needs for these conventions: (1) Functional/Transitive/Symmetric/InverseObjectProperties emission requires the variable-allocator and per-direction allocator-freshness conventions; (2) the `p1_property_characteristics` STRUCTURAL_ONLY placeholder fill-in commits the lifter to a byte-exact term-tree shape that becomes the determinism contract per API §6.1.1; (3) the cycle-guard layer-translation question (lifter vs evaluator responsibility) cannot be deferred — it is a load-bearing decision for what the FOL term tree is allowed to contain. Subsequent steps (Steps 6, 7, 8) added §§7-9 resolutions and Step 9.4 doc-pass formalizes §10.

**Consequences:**
- Future contributors implementing Phase 1 Steps 6-9 (or any post-Phase-1 lifter extension) inherit these conventions; deviations require a follow-up ADR with implementation evidence.
- The Phase 3 evaluator's Prolog-rule-emission algorithm has a documented contract: ingest classical-FOL term trees and apply the visited-ancestor cycle-guard at ingestion time.
- All ADR-007 sections §§1-10 are Resolved at Phase 1 exit. Phase 2+ extensions to ADR-007 (e.g., projector-side conventions) land as new sections in the same document; pre-existing sections do not get re-litigated without architect-banked implementation evidence per spec §0.2.

---

## ADR-008: OFI deontic deferred from v0.1 to v0.2

**Date:** 2026-05-05 (drafted at v3.3 catalogue closeout per Orchestrator architectural concern; ratified Accepted at architect's bundled ADR-008 + ADR-009 routing cycle ruling 2026-05-05)

**Status:** Accepted (architect-ratified post-freeze spec change per spec §0.2.3, evidence-gated change category "consumer-facing breakage")

**Decision:** Remove `ofi/deontic.json` from spec §3.6.1's v0.1 ARC module list. The eight OFI deontic relation rows authored in `project/relations_catalogue_v3_3.tsv` (rows 129-136) are preserved with module assignment changed from `ofi/deontic` to `[V0.2-CANDIDATE]`; they do NOT compile to a v0.1 ARC module and are NOT loaded by the v0.1 build pipeline. OFI deontic content returns to scope at v0.2.

**Context.** v3.3 catalogue regeneration discipline surfaced that the eight OFI rows carry interim placeholder IRIs `ofi:0000001` through `ofi:0000008`. Finalization of these IRIs depends on the external Reified Constitutive Relations Specification §3 (referenced in spec §17.7), which has not yet published. Shipping placeholder IRIs in v0.1 creates a consumer-facing commitment OFBT cannot honor without the external spec's stabilization.

The Orchestrator (2026-05-05) raised the architectural concern: "OFI doesn't belong in v0.1 — it's not a real ontology in the BFO/CCO sense; it's OFBT-internally-minted content pending an external specification." Bundled with ADR-009 into one architect routing cycle.

**Implementation evidence per spec §0.2.3.** Falls under "consumer-facing breakage" evidence category:

- v3.3 catalogue's 8 OFI rows carry `[PROVENANCE-AUTHORED]` markers explicitly (no source ontology to verify against).
- Interim IRIs are not stable; the external spec may finalize them differently.
- Shipping placeholder IRIs in v0.1 commits downstream consumers to IRIs that may change at v0.2 — exactly what §0.2.3 evidence-gating exists to prevent.
- v0.1 test corpus does not currently exercise OFI deontic content (Phases 1-6 use BFO/CCO/IAO; only Phase 7 was scoped to exercise OFI). Removing OFI from v0.1 does not break any existing fixture.

**Architect ruling (verbatim, 2026-05-05):** "The evidence is exactly what §0.2.3 was designed to gate on... Treating OFI as a real ontology in v0.1 alongside BFO/CCO/IAO conflates two structurally different things: BFO/CCO/IAO are upstream-canonical with stable IRIs; OFI is OFBT-internal with provisional IRIs. Spec §3.6.1's module list should reflect that distinction. v0.2 is the right reintroduction point — when the external dependency has stabilized, OFI returns via a new ADR with implementation evidence."

**Phase 7 scope ruling (Option A):** Phase 7 retains scope reduction. Compatibility shim work + parallel-run mode + expected-divergence baseline + bundle budget CI gating + coverage matrix CI all stay in Phase 7. `constitution.ttl` Article I §2 pipeline rolls forward to Phase 8 as a verification-gate-prep deliverable. Phase 8 scope under Option A: Verification Gate Guide + Fandaws-side gate response + npm publish + tagged release + the rolled-forward `constitution.ttl` pipeline as the migration-discipline-demonstrating artifact.

**Banked principle (architect-ratified):** "When OFBT depends on an external specification that has not yet stabilized, OFBT does not ship dependent content in v0.1. The dependent content is authored as a v0.2 candidate and added back via ADR when the external dependency stabilizes." This generalizes spec §0.2.3 honest-admission discipline to external-dependency management. Folded into `arc/AUTHORING_DISCIPLINE.md` "External-dependency management — when v0.1 doesn't ship dependent content" subsection.

**Consequences (post-ratification implementation):**

- Spec §3.6.1 module list: `ofi/deontic.json` removed (editorial revision per §0.2.1)
- Spec §3.6.4 module dependencies: `ofi/deontic` removed from dependency graph
- ROADMAP Phase 7 scope: OFI deontic ARC module deliverable removed; compatibility shim retained
- ROADMAP Phase 8 scope: `constitution.ttl` Article I §2 pipeline rolled forward as verification-gate-prep deliverable
- Plan §3.8 (Phase 7) revised per Option A
- Plan §3.9 (Phase 8) revised to receive the rolled-forward `constitution.ttl` work
- Plan §1.3 (out of scope for v0.1): adds OFI deferral
- v3.3 catalogue rows 129-136: Module column flipped from `ofi/deontic` to `[V0.2-CANDIDATE]`
- `scripts/build-arc.js`: skip-`[V0.2-CANDIDATE]` logic added for v0.1 module emission
- `arc/AUTHORING_DISCIPLINE.md`: External-dependency management section added per banked principle
- ADR record: this entry, references architect ruling 2026-05-05

## ADR-009: Four new ARC modules added per v0.1 corpus evidence

**Date:** 2026-05-05 (drafted at v3.3 catalogue closeout; ratified Accepted at architect's bundled ADR-008 + ADR-009 routing cycle ruling 2026-05-05)

**Status:** Accepted (architect-ratified post-freeze spec change per spec §0.2.3, evidence-gated change category "consumer-facing breakage")

**Decision:** Add four ARC modules to spec §3.6.1's v0.1 module list:

| Module | Row count in v3.3 | Primary CCO content |
|---|---|---|
| `cco/measurement.json` | 8 | Measurement units, reference systems, time zones, geospatial coordinate reference systems |
| `cco/aggregate.json` | 5 | Object aggregate bearer-of, inheres-in-aggregate, capability-of-aggregate |
| `cco/organizational.json` | 14 | Affiliation, supervision, organizational context, subordinate roles, interest-bearing, delimitation |
| `cco/deontic.json` | 8 | CCO's deontic vocabulary: prescribes, prohibits, permits, requires (Directive→Action) |

**Context.** v3.3 catalogue regeneration (verified against loaded BFO 2020 + CCO + IAO triplestore via SPARQL) surfaced 35 CCO rows that do not fit the existing five-module taxonomy from spec §3.6.1. The deterministic module-assignment rule (namespace + property-path closure to BFO ancestor) places these rows in modules the spec doesn't currently enumerate.

**Implementation evidence per spec §0.2.3.** Falls under "consumer-facing breakage" evidence category:

- v0.1 CCO Geospatial test corpus exercises `is_geospatial_coordinate_reference_system_of` and `uses_geospatial_coordinate_reference_system`. These don't fit `cco/realizable-holding` or `cco/mereotopology`; they belong in `cco/measurement`.
- v0.1 CCO Agent test corpus exercises affiliation, supervision, organizational hierarchies. These don't fit `cco/realizable-holding`; they belong in `cco/organizational`.
- CCO aggregate vocabulary: collective bearer-of pattern doesn't fit `cco/realizable-holding`'s individual realizable-holding pattern. Belongs in `cco/aggregate`.
- CCO deontic vocabulary: distinct from OFI deontic. CCO covers Directive→Action; OFI (deferred per ADR-008) covers Directive→Issuing-Agent and the RDM v1.2.1 chain. Belongs in `cco/deontic`.

Without these four modules, 35 CCO rows have no valid module assignment in v0.1. Spec's five-module taxonomy is provably insufficient for v0.1's actual CCO content scope.

**Architect ruling (verbatim, 2026-05-05):** "The evidence is the v3.3 catalogue itself, which is the most rigorous evidence form §0.2.3 admits. The deterministic module-assignment rule's outputs are the evidence... Approving the four-module addition aligns the spec with what the deterministic rule produces, rather than forcing 35 rows into ill-fitting existing modules."

**Module dependencies (per spec §3.6.4 pattern):**

- `cco/measurement` depends on `core/bfo-2020` (uses `BFO_0000084` specifically_depends_on, `BFO_0000101` generically_depends_on)
- `cco/aggregate` depends on `core/bfo-2020` (Object Aggregate is a BFO category; multi-ancestor to `BFO_0000196` bearer_of and `BFO_0000194` specifically_depended_on_by)
- `cco/organizational` depends on `core/bfo-2020` (Organization is a BFO category)
- `cco/deontic` depends on `core/iao-information` (Directive is an Information Content Entity per IAO)

**Per-module size budgets (architect-ratified):**

- `cco/measurement.json` ≤ 8 KB minified
- `cco/aggregate.json` ≤ 5 KB minified
- `cco/organizational.json` ≤ 12 KB minified
- `cco/deontic.json` ≤ 8 KB minified

Architect's additional refinement: API spec §13.4 must enumerate the per-module caps so the Phase 7 bundle CI gate can enforce per-module rather than per-total. Current spec §13.4.1's "≤ 15-20 KB" generic optional-module size is insufficient documentation; v0.1.7.x patch updates §13.4 with the per-CCO-module table.

**Cross-module compatibility — `cco/deontic` vs `ofi/deontic`:** load-bearing distinction even with ADR-008's OFI deferral. CCO covers Directive→Action; OFI covers Directive→Issuing-Agent. v0.1 ships `cco/deontic` only; v0.2's eventual OFI re-introduction adds `ofi/deontic` alongside (not replacing). Naming distinction matters now, not just at v0.2. Folded into `arc/AUTHORING_DISCIPLINE.md` "CCO vs OFI deontic distinction" subsection.

**Banked principle (architect-ratified):** "When v0.1 implementation reveals that the spec's module taxonomy is insufficient for the actual content scope, the taxonomy expands via §0.2.3 evidence-gated change rather than the content being forced into ill-fitting existing modules. The deterministic module-assignment rule's outputs are the evidence." Generalizes the §0.2.3 discipline beyond OFI/external-dependency cases to any case where deterministic-rule outputs disagree with frozen-spec taxonomy.

**Consequences (post-ratification implementation):**

- Spec §3.6.1 module list: four modules added (editorial revision per §0.2.1; combined with ADR-008's removal, list grows from 5 to 8)
- Spec §3.6.4 module dependencies: four new dependency entries
- API spec §13.4: per-CCO-module size budget table enumerated; CI gate enforces per-module caps
- ROADMAP Phase 6 scope: extended to six CCO modules (original two + four new)
- Plan §3.7 (Phase 6) revised
- `scripts/lint-arc.js`: `MODULE_DEPS` map extended with four new modules
- `scripts/build-arc.js`: four new module emitters
- `arc/AUTHORING_DISCIPLINE.md`: "CCO vs OFI deontic distinction" subsection added per banked principle

## Bankable observations from the bundled ADR-008 + ADR-009 routing cycle

**Cycle-density mid-vs-between-phase distinction (architect-banked 2026-05-05).** Mid-phase escalations and between-phase architectural cycles are different cadence categories. The same numeric count at different positions has different implications. Phase 1's mid-phase count: 3 (Step 4 fixture amendment, Step 5 ADR-007 + reserved-predicate, BFO/CLIF parity initial) plus 1 cycle-completion (BFO/CLIF Layer A correction). Between-phase count: 1 (this ADR-008 + ADR-009 cycle). Future Phase 2+ mid-phase cycles weigh against Phase 1's 3, not against the cumulative 5. Between-phase cycles increment a separate counter.

**External-dependency management discipline.** Per ADR-008 banked principle. v0.1 does not ship content dependent on unstable external specifications. Pattern: author the dependent content as `[V0.2-CANDIDATE]` in catalogue; do not include in v0.1 ARC module compilation; reintroduce via new ADR when external dependency stabilizes.

**Module taxonomy expansion via deterministic-rule evidence.** Per ADR-009 banked principle. When deterministic-rule outputs disagree with frozen-spec taxonomy, the spec expands via §0.2.3 evidence-gated change rather than forcing content into ill-fitting existing modules.
